Hello

I'm Matthieu; welcome by! This profile is an opportunity for me to track my projects, and interact with the community. My main topic of interest is software interfacing, and I would gladly chat about it (although I would not mind discussing culture, books, or music as well 😄). Maybe you would like to collaborate or dicuss work opportunties, instead. I would also be fine with that.

Take care, and talk soon..
