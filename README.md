Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Matthieu; welcome by! This profile is an opportunity for me to track my projects, and interact with the community. My main topics of interest is software interfacing, and I would gladly chat about it (although I would not mind discussing culture, books, or music as well ðŸ˜„). Maybe you would like to collaborate or dicuss work opportunties, instead. I would also be fine with that.

In the meantime, Happy viewing!
